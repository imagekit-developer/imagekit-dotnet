## [3.1.0] - 2020-09-03
### Added
- Async methods for all asynchronous calls
- `ClientImagekit` that supports client upload without the private key
- Support for .NET Standard 2.1
- `ImagekitResponse.FileId`
- Some XML documentation

### Changed
- The `Imagekit.Imagekit` class is deprecated; use `ServerImagekit` instead
- Fix issue where `isPrivateFile` was not included on upload
- Fix issue where type of `Gps.GPSLatitude`, `Gps.GPSLongitude`, and `GPSTimeStamp` was incorrect
- Some of the `ArgumentException`s are now `ArgumentNullException` and set the `ParamName` property of the exception. This is not a binary breaking change as `ArgumentNullException` inherits from `ArgumentException`, but if you are specifically looking for the `ArgumentException` type exactly, you may see a runtime issue, although this is very unlikely.
